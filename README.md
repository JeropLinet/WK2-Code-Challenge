#### By *Kibet Linet Jerop*

## Description
This repository contains three diffrent challanges that are stated below:

#### => Swap-case System
  A system that swaps the case of any character in the sentence input. If the character is in upper case the program swaps it to be in lower case.

#### => Generate-Arrays-Between System
  This program allows a user to input two numbers and generates a new array between them.
  For example;
  if the inserted numbers are [1,6] the program outputs
  [1,2,3,4,5,6]

#### => Prime-Number-Identifier System
  This system has a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
  For example;
  if the inserted numbers are [1,2,3,4,5,6] the program outputs
  [2,3,5]
