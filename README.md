## Description
from this repository we have three different projects that can beviewed with their own pages when the HTML part is open,

=> Swap-case System
A system that swaps the case of any character in the sentence input. If the character is in upper case the program swaps it to be in lower case.

=> Generate-Arrays System
This program allows a user to input two numbers and generates a new array between them.
 For example;
  if the inserted numbers are [1,6] the program outputs
  [1,2,3,4,5,6]

=> Prime-Number-Identifier System
This system has a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
For example;
if the inserted numbers are [1,2,3,4,5,6] the program outputs
[2,3,5]
